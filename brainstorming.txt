# Brainstorming ideas

## Data formatting
- Need to remove spaces at the end of individual cells / before commas in csv
- Need to replace ? with N/A or similar
- Maybe need to convert data format
- Maybe remove ML and VP in categories for improved readability
- Be aware of prices that have comma and are in "" in csv

## Data exploration
- Several minus or negative daily units
- Competitor prices only know for 63% of lines

## Models


## External data
