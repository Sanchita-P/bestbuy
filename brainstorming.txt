# Brainstorming ideas

## Data formatting
- Need to remove spaces at the end of individual entries / before commas in csv
- Need to replace ? with N/A or similar
- Maybe need to convert date format
- Maybe remove ML and VP in categories for improved readability
- Be aware of prices that have comma and are in "" in csv
- ...

## Data exploration
- Several negative or zero daily units
- Competitor prices not know for 63% of entries
- Checking sales across categories (diff levels) and time
- 

## Models
- Hierarchical Bayesian model: Create separate models for each level of the given hierarchy -> fit using Bayesian inference -> Use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in PyMC3 Python library
- ARIMA
- XGBoost
- Decision tree or random forest
- Less suitable:
-- Exponential smoothing: there are probably no trends in our data
-- Neural networks: might take too long and hence decrease our score
- Feature based gradient boosting
- LSTM


## External data
- Inflation data: https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_inflation_rate
- University of Michigan's Consumer sentiment index -> http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/tables.html
- Weather data: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events
- Demographics (probably less suitable)
- Household spending: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE
- Fed's supply chain pressure index: https://ycharts.com/indicators/global_supply_chain_pressure_index
- Covid cases: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases

## Features
- Previous sales lag (diff intervals)
- Amount of discount
- Price of previous weeks (diff intervals)
- Price elasticity (internal data)
- Time since last promotion
- Number of promotions greater than XX%
- Seasonal index feature (inflation, internal, etc.)
- Competitor prices
- Inventory levels - status
- Holiday features

## Questions
- Missing data
