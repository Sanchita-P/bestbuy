# Brainstorming ideas

## Data formatting
- Need to remove spaces at the end of individual entries / before commas in csv
- Need to replace ? with N/A or similar
- Maybe need to convert date format
- Maybe remove ML and VP in categories for improved readability
- Be aware of prices that have comma and are in "" in csv
- ...

## Data exploration
- Several negative or zero daily units
- Competitor prices not know for 63% of entries
- ...

## Models
- Hierarchical Bayesian model: Create separate models for each level of the given hierarchy -> fit using Bayesian inference -> Use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in PyMC3 Python library
- ARIMA
- XGBoost
- Decision tree or random forest
- Less suitable:
-- Exponential smoothing: there are probably no trends in our data
-- Neural networks: might take too long and hence decrease our score


## External data
- Inflation data
- University of Michigan's Consumer sentiment index
- Weather data
- Demographics (probably less suitable)
- Household spending
- Fed's supply chain pressure index
